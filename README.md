This repository contains all the projects coded at Electr√≥nica Digital 3 subject.
At this instance, all the coding is made on C language (unknown at the first moment), using the LPC1769 microcontroller from NXP Semiconductors.
The LPC1769 is an M3 Cortex that has only one thread and the intention is to understand how the microprocessors work at a low level.
